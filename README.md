   Portfolio:
        In my portfolio I have included a picture of myself and photos I have taken throughout my career of being a photographer. Photography is one of my passions in life, one of the things I hope to gain from this class is the ability to build myself an absolutely amazing website for my photos where people can look at them on a flawless sight. From the little bit of coding I have done in this class, it is quickly becoming another passion of mine and being able to integrate the both of them into one project really excited me. 

    Personally I have a love/hate relationship with bootstrap. It is an amazing resource to make something that would be norrmally fairly difficult, much easier, though there is thing that I still have difficulty with. The main thing being columns and rows. They never seem to do what I want them to do, and I am not exactly sure what I am doing wrong in regard to that. Hoping to figure it out with more practice with it.

    The things I am proud about with the project is making all the nav bar links work, adding my own personal photos to the portfolio and trying my hardest with it to make it as good as possible. On the otherhand, I feel like the contact page could be much better and I wish I knew how to using rows and columns better, it's simple in concept but in practice it's actually quite difficult.
